        <p>I want to begin by expressing my deepest apologies for the recent turmoil and confusion I've caused in our friendship. My behavior has been toxic, and I deeply regret the pain it has caused you.
I've been going through a difficult time, and instead of handling it in a healthy way, I ended up isolating myself and even suggested breaking our friendship, which was completely unfair to you and hurtful. I allowed my own insecurities and issues to overshadow our friendship, and for that, I am truly sorry. I'm deeply sorry for the pain I've caused you
Please know that I value our friendship more than words can express, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to rebuild the trust and connection we once shared. Our friendship means everything to me, and I'll do whatever it takes to make things right between us. If you are willing to give me another chance, I promise be the supportive and understanding friend you deserve.
</p>
